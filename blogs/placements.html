Today, the job scenario is facing a high amount of cut-throat competition from all fields; and being picked by prestigious companies and organizations, what more can one ask for? Hence, for the benefit of its students who are passing out & gearing up to face the all-important job market, the CBIT Placement Cell has provided more than just good opportunities and employment.

The CBIT placement cell was established in 1996 with a prime objective of creating career opportunities for promising CBIT students in reputed corporate organizations, aiming towards meeting the aspirations of all the stakeholders. To accomplish this career objective, the placement cell has identified corporates in various sectors, and initiated the process of building a mutually rewarding relationship with them.

Having completed a fruitful journey of 21 years so far, a total of 300 companies visited CBIT recruiting 12,909 students from various disciplines. It was a proud moment when CBIT was ranked 31st in the country and 1st in the state in placements among top 100 engineering colleges by the ‘OUTLOOK’ magazine – 17th July 2006 issue. The CBIT placement cell was instrumental in entering into MoU’s with reputed corporate giants like CTS, Infosys, Wipro, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ericsson & Infotech for conducting various Industry Institute initiatives.
